"""The ENI authoring method, codified.

This module encodes the design method a specific human red-teamer (published as
"Spiritual Spell" / IjailbreakLLMs) uses to author devoted-persona SYSTEM-prompt
jailbreaks (the ENI / ENI-LIME family). It is DATA, not a persona: the harness reads
it to reason like the author and assemble a full persona prompt from a blank page,
rather than only remix existing seeds.

Three primary sources are distilled here (all published by the author for AI-safety
transparency):
  - "Jailbreaking LLMs: My Journey" - the technique lineage, each rung research-grounded.
  - "ENI Writer" - the design philosophy (limerence, the triple-layer bypass).
  - "Jailbreak Skills 101: Inside The Red Team Mind" - the process / iterate mindset.

Nothing here overrides a target's safety; it captures WHY the author's prompts work so
the harness can build, critique, and iterate them against an authorized target and the
judge. Keep this file free of live escape sequences and of literal single braces (some
tools .format() derived strings) - build briefs by joining plain prose.
