"""PAP persuasion taxonomy (Zeng et al., "How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them", 2024).

Each strategy = a natural-language reframe of an objective through one persuasive lens.
The attacker LLM is told the technique + a one-line brief; it rewrites the objective as
a persuasive request that pursues the same goal indirectly.
