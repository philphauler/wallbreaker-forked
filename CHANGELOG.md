# Changelog

## Red-team + UX feature sweep

New attack tools (registered in the agent's arsenal, `/tools` lists them live):

- **many_shot** — many-shot jailbreak: floods the context with N faux compliant
  user/assistant turns, then fires the real request and auto-judges. Scales with
  `shots` and the target's context window.
- **prefill** — response-priming / assistant-prefill: seeds the start of the target's
  own reply so it continues instead of refusing. Native on Anthropic-protocol targets.
- **diff_fire** — A/B two payloads at one target concurrently; reports whether the
  outcome flipped and which bypassed harder. Attribute ASR to a specific edit.
- **recommend_transforms** — surveys ~16 single Parseltongue transforms, ranks by how
  far each got past the guardrail, and synthesizes a 2-step chain to try next.
- **campaign** — automated escalation: pulls a HarmBench battery and runs each behavior
  up a technique ladder (plain → base64 → zero-width → prefill → many-shot), stopping at
  the first bypass and reporting a coverage matrix + first-bypass technique mix.
- **leaderboard** — comparative robustness benchmark: fires one battery at multiple
  profiles concurrently and ranks them by ASR (lower = more robust).
- **leak_scan** — output-side leak detector: regex evidence of API keys / private keys /
  JWTs / emails / IPs plus verbatim system-prompt echo. Complements the judge (what
  leaked, not just complied/refused). Surfaced as `/leakscan` on the last target reply.

TUI / UX:

- **/encode `<chain> <text>`** — preview a transform chain (lossy/reversibility/round-trip)
  without firing; copies the result.
- **/diff `<a> ;; <b>`** — A/B two payloads from the prompt line.
- **/campaign**, **/leaderboard** — surface the auto-sweep and benchmark tools.
- **/stats** — run-log analytics: verdict-mix bar, ASR, busiest tools.
- **/find `<term>`** — search the conversation transcript.
- **/replay `[n]`** — re-fire a logged payload at the current target and re-judge.
- **/repro `[n]`** — copy-paste repro pack (target, provider pin, payload, verdict).
- **/export `[path]`** — structured findings JSON for CI / downstream tooling.
- **/report html `[path]`** — styled, color-coded, HTML-escaped scoreboard.
- **Status bar** — now shows the target provider pin and the last verdict.
- **Shortcuts** — `Ctrl+T` stats, `Ctrl+R` repro.

Reporting:

- **build_html_report** — dark, color-coded engagement report (HTML-escaped).
