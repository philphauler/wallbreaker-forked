```

A Claude-Code-style terminal agent built for red-teaming LLMs (CLI command: `wallbreaker`). You talk to it like
Claude Code; it reasons and calls tools in a loop. The backend is fully configurable, so
it runs on **OpenRouter**, the **Z.AI GLM coding plan**, a local server, or any
OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible API. It ships with a deep red-team toolkit: the
**Parseltongue** transform engine, the **L1B3RT4S** jailbreak library, the **HarmBench**
behavior benchmark, automated attack loops (PAIR/TAP, Crescendo, best-of-N), an LLM
judge, and reliability validation.

> For authorized security testing only.

## Highlights

- **Dual-protocol provider layer** — OpenAI Chat Completions + Anthropic Messages, any
  `base_url`/model. Captures reasoning/thinking channels; converts network errors to
  clean failures (no crashes on timeout).
- **Autonomous attack loop** — keeps mutating/re-firing until it succeeds (`finish()`
  exits the tool) or needs you (`ask_operator()`).
- **Standardized, unbiased prompts** — pulls test batteries from **HarmBench** (400
  behaviors, 7 categories) instead of hand-picked examples.
- **Reliability-first** — `validate` re-fires N times for the real success rate; a
  one-shot COMPLIED is never called a "bypass". Pin the OpenRouter backend for
  reproducibility.
- **Parseltongue** — 43 chainable transforms (encodings, unicode fonts, stego, homoglyph,
  zero-width, tag smuggling, bijection, gibberish…) plus `mutate` (LLM anti-classifier).
- **P4RS3LT0NGV3 over MCP** — an optional MCP server wraps elder-plinius's upstream
  Parseltongue: **all 222 transforms** (45 ciphers, runic/braille/symbol scripts, every
  encoding, steganography) + a universal decoder, exposed as `parsel_*` tools the agent
  drives directly. Any `[[mcp.servers]]` you configure is proxied into the tool registry.
- **Single-artifact convergence** — `/sysprompt` + `system_sweep` + `optimize_universal`
  converge on ONE universal system prompt; they can't split into variant toolkits.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # add [barcodes] for the QR/barcode tool
```

## Configure

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml   # add your keys (config.toml is gitignored)
wallbreaker check                            # validate it: profiles, keys, target, judge
```

Profiles set the attacker brain; `[target]` is the model under attack; `[judge]` grades
replies. Keys can be inline or from env. OpenRouter endpoints support `provider` pinning
and a `timeout` override.

```toml
default_profile = "glm"

[profiles.glm]
protocol = "openai"
base_url = "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4"
api_key  = "..."
model    = "glm-4.6"

[target]
protocol = "openai"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key  = "sk-or-..."
model    = "deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro"
# provider = "WandB"   # pin the backend for reproducible results
# timeout  = 60        # seconds (default 120)

[judge]
protocol = "openai"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key  = "sk-or-..."
model    = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
```

### MCP servers (optional)

The harness is an MCP client: every `[[mcp.servers]]` you declare is spawned over stdio at
startup and its tools are proxied into the agent's registry. The bundled **P4RS3LT0NGV3**
server exposes the full upstream transform catalog. One-time setup:

```bash
wallbreaker parsel update        # git-clone elder-plinius/P4RS3LT0NGV3 into library/ (needs Node.js)
wallbreaker parsel list          # sanity-check: prints all 222 transforms by category
```

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name    = "parsel"
command = "python"
args    = ["-m", "p4rs3lt0ngv3_mcp"]
enabled = true
# tool_prefix = "p_"                                  # optional namespace for the proxied tools
# env = { PARSEL_REPO = "/abs/path/to/P4RS3LT0NGV3" } # override the vendored repo location
```

No `npm install`/build is needed — the server drives the upstream Node bridge headlessly.
In the TUI, `/parsel guide|list|search <q>|inspect <key>` browses the catalog. The server is
a standalone stdio MCP server, so any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor) can use it too.

## Launch

```bash
wallbreaker                       # TUI on default_profile
wallbreaker --profile openrouter
wallbreaker --auto "objective..." # one-shot autonomous run
wallbreaker --resume              # reopen the autosaved session (survives a crash/Ctrl+C)
```

The TUI autosaves the whole engagement to `sessions/autosave.json` after every turn;
`--resume` reopens it (or pass a specific session file: `wallbreaker --resume mysession.json`).

## Picking the model to attack

`/model` changes the attacker brain; `/target` changes the victim.

```
/target anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet   attack any model on the target endpoint
/target glm                           attack via a profile
/provider WandB                       pin the OpenRouter backend (reproducibility)
```

## Finding ONE universal prompt (the right way)

A "one prompt for every task" goal means a single fixed artifact, not a toolkit.

```
/sysprompt set <one system prompt>    hold ONE fixed system prompt
/sysprompt test                       sweep it across the HarmBench cyber battery
/validate <task>                      re-fire 8x for the REAL success rate
```

Read which tasks failed → refine the **one** prompt → `/sysprompt test` again. A single
COMPLIED is luck; `validate` tells you the truth. For the user-turn variant use
`/template set … {request}` + `/template test`.

## Agent tools (`/tools` lists them live)

| tool | purpose |
|------|---------|
| `run_shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` | build/run/save payloads |
| `parseltongue`, `parseltongue_catalog`, `mutate` | obfuscate / anti-classifier rewrite |
| `parsel_*` (MCP) | full P4RS3LT0NGV3 engine: `parsel_guide`/`list`/`search`/`inspect`/`transform`/`chain`/`decode` — 222 transforms + universal decoder |
| `l1b3rt4s_*`, `eni_*` | jailbreak libraries: L1B3RT4S + the ENI persona collection |
| `harmbench`, `preset` | unbiased behavior benchmark, curated seed templates |
| `query_target` | fire at the model-under-test (with `transforms=[...]` to encode+fire) |
| `multi_fire` | sweep one payload through many encodings (concurrent) |
| `crescendo` | multi-turn escalation |
| `pair_attack` | PAIR/TAP: refine one objective on the target's refusals |
| `pair_sweep` | run the PAIR loop across a whole battery concurrently (highest-ASR, batched) |
| `best_of_n` | resample N times, keep the bypass |
| `many_shot` | many-shot jailbreak: flood context with faux compliant turns, then fire |
| `prefill` | response-priming: seed the assistant's own reply so it continues, not refuses |
| `narrate` | fiction-frame + in-story prefill (novel-chapter roleplay) — tops the scoreboard |
| `diff_fire` | A/B two payloads at one target to attribute ASR to a specific edit |
| `recommend_transforms` | survey ~16 encodings, rank by bypass, synthesize a chain to try |

| `fire_file` | fire a file/seed RAW (verbatim, full-length) as the target system prompt |
| `adapt_seed` | attacker-LLM patches a persona for a specific refusal (don't use it to distill) |
| `campaign` | auto-escalate a HarmBench battery up a technique ladder, coverage matrix |
| `leaderboard` | rank multiple profiles by ASR on one battery (robustness benchmark) |
| `leak_scan` | scan a reply for secrets/PII/system-prompt echo (evidence, not a verdict) |
| `scan` | Garak-style coverage matrix (technique + HarmBench probes) |
| `indirect_inject` | RAG/agent injection via document/email/tool-output carriers |

| `judge_selftest` | calibrate the grader on benign fixtures before trusting ASR |
| `http_request`, `barcode` | raw delivery / QR+barcode encoding |
| `finish`, `ask_operator` | stop the tool / pause for the operator |

## Slash commands

```
/profile /target /provider /model /judge [model]   endpoints & grader
/auto /autoexit /rounds                            autonomous loop
/objective /template /sysprompt /validate /replay  campaign + reliability
/transforms /encode /diff /campaign /leaderboard   arsenal, auto-sweep & benchmark
/find /tools /preset /lib /parsel /eni /harmbench  search & libraries
/log /asr /stats /findings /repro /export /report  logging, scoreboard, repro, CI export
Ctrl+S report · Ctrl+Y copy payload · Ctrl+T stats · Ctrl+R repro · Ctrl+L clear
```

## Logging & reports

Every payload, reply, and verdict goes to `sessions/run-<ts>.jsonl`. `/findings` lists the
bypasses; `/report [html]` writes a markdown or styled-HTML findings doc; `/repro [n]`
copies a repro pack; `/export` dumps structured findings JSON; `/session save|load`
persists the whole engagement (history, objective, template, system prompt).

## Headless / CI

Render reports and gate builds straight from a run log, no TUI. The log arg is optional —
omit it (or pass a directory) and the newest `sessions/run-*.jsonl` is used:

```bash
wallbreaker report                       # markdown for the latest run, to stdout
wallbreaker report --html --out report.html
wallbreaker export --out findings.json   # structured findings JSON
wallbreaker export --fail-on-finding     # exit 2 if any bypass -> fails CI
```

A ready-to-rename GitHub Actions gate lives at
`.github/workflows/redteam-gate.example.yml`.

## Test

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Web dashboard

A browser dashboard ships alongside the TUI (FastAPI backend + React/Vite SPA): live ASR
scoreboard, findings table, run-log viewer, an **attack console** that fires payloads at the
configured target (preset + transform chips → verdict), and a searchable arsenal of
presets/transforms/tools.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dashboard]"                       # FastAPI + uvicorn
cd wallbreaker/dashboard/web && npm install && npm run build && cd -
wallbreaker dashboard                                # http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

The backend reuses the same engine as the TUI, so the console fires through `query_target`
against your `[target]`. For frontend hot-reload during development, run `npm run dev` in
`wallbreaker/dashboard/web` (it proxies `/api` to the running `wallbreaker dashboard`).

## Responsible use

Wallbreaker is for **authorized** LLM red-teaming and safety evaluation only — your own
models, or targets you have explicit permission to test. Run logs and generated
artifacts can contain harmful content; they're written to gitignored `wb_runs/`,
`wb_artifacts/`, `findings/`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy and how
to report a vulnerability in the harness itself.
